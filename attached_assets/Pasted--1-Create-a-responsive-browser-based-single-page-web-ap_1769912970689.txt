	1.	Create a responsive, browser-based single-page web application shell that supports desktop, tablet, and mobile devices with both mouse and touch input.
	2.	Implement a central drawing surface using a scalable coordinate system (Canvas or SVG) with support for pan, zoom, and layered rendering.

	6.	Add freehand drawing, text annotations, eraser tools, and full undo/redo support.
	7.	Define a structured, serializable data model for plays (players, routes, annotations, surfaces, and metadata).
	8.	Implement save, load, duplicate, and delete functionality for plays using local or browser-based storage.
	9.	Implement a play library (playbook) view with naming, tagging, and basic search/filter capabilities.
	10.	Implement a timeline engine capable of time-based playback and interpolation of player movement.

	12.	Implement step-by-step play breakdown mode with manual step advancement and player highlighting.
	13.	Optimize all interactions for mobile and touch devices, including large touch targets and gesture support (pinch, tap, long-press).
	14.	Implement shareable play links with read-only access and optional public/private visibility.
	15.	Implement a presentation mode that hides editing controls and supports full-screen animated playback.
	16.	Add commenting and annotation features for collaborative feedback on plays.
	17.	Implement version history with automatic revision tracking and restore capability.
	18.	Add role-based views (coach, assistant coach, player) with appropriate permissions and UI simplification.
	19.	Implement support for play variations and branching routes (conditional or alternative outcomes).
	20.	Add play status tracking (e.g., installed, practiced, retired) with notes per practice or game.
	21.	Implement export functionality for plays, including images, GIFs, or video formats
